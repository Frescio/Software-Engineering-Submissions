## Farm Frescio
 
# Problem Statement :

Frescio is a website which aims to promote Smart Agriculture among farmers. It is a digital hub for farmers to learn more about farming, cultivating their crops and recommendation systems for various problems they might face and at the same time providing a platform to sell their produce at fair prices by connecting them directly to buyers. Frescio is being designed to help farmers at every step of their journey. 

# Our Motivation:

1. Farming is one of the major sectors that influences India’s economic growth. Agriculture alone contributes around 20 percent to India’s GDP according to the Economic Survey 2020-2021.
2. More than 28 farmers and farm labourers die by suicide in India every day, according to the 2021 State of India’s Environment (SoE) report. Suicide among farmers has been a routine in India for the last 20 years and the suicide rate has been increasing over these years. 
3. The rising cost of food in the past years is often blamed on a multi-layered system of middlemen involved in the distribution of produce from farmers to consumers. Over the years, several layers of intermediaries, by lengthening the supply chain, declined farmers from the fair income for their produce.
4. Another reason behind this is the slow upgradation in the Agriculture Sector, and also lack of awareness among Farmers about Modern Agricultural Practices.
5. We were also inspired by the recent events that happened to the farmers in our nation and wanted to do something which might be a thoughtful initiative towards a better future for the food providers of our country.
